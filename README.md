<h1>Forkify</h1>
This is a recipe application I built as a project in Jonas's JavaScript course.

<h2>Overview</h2>
Forkify allows users to search for recipes, view recipe details, add recipes to bookmarks, and upload their own recipes.<br />
I implemented the main JavaScript functionality and logic for this application using MVC architecture. The HTML and CSS were provided by the course.

<h2>Features</h2>
Search recipes using the ForkifyV2 API<br />
View recipe details including ingredients, instructions, and nutrition<br />
Add recipes to bookmarks for later access\
Upload new recipes to local storage (does not connect to backend API)<br />

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
Consuming data from an external API<br />
Sending data to an external API<br />
Implementing search, bookmarking, and form uploading functionality<br />
Modular JavaScript code organization using MVC architecture<br />
Async JavaScript with promises and async/await<br />
Web performance optimization techniques<br />
